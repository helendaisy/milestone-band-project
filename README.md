### Design Choices 

The overall feel of the site should be simple and clean and inkeeping with the band's overall "rock" brand. 
The following choices were made with this in mind. 

#### Fonts 

The font chosen is Archivo narrow which is in line with the rest of the styling inkeeping with the style of the most 
recent album released by the band. It has stright lines and is a simple, easy to read font. 

<https://fonts.google.com/> reviewed when deciding on font styling for the site. 

#### Icons 

- Standard icons for brands such as spotify, apple, social media used for familiarity of the user. 
- Mainpage has the Foo Fighters Logo from the most recent album as an icon header creating recognition when the user goes to buy or stream the album. 
- Favicon is the same as the logo used through the site to provide consistency throughout.

#### Colors

- Background color throughout #060505 selected to match the styling of the most recent album and the official band website to credit familiarity and consistency. 
- Font color #d4Af37 used throughout selected to match the color of the logo and styling on the most recent album to show consistency and familiarity.  
- Band info page close button on modal made #ffffff for ease of user to identify how to close the window. 
- Calendar color #d4Af37 for header and #f9f2e0 for body used to make a recognisible calendar format, with the #f9f2e0 a big contrast to background and header to make it instantly noticeable. 

Color selection made using - 
- <https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/>
- <https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/Gold_Color.html> 

#### Styling 

- Each page is styled with a strong cover image giving an indication of the content of the page.
- Cover images across all pages styled at 80% screen height across all devices with the page header visible under the image to encourage user to scroll down to see the rest of the content. 
- Footer icons styled at 30px so they are easily noticed. Standard icons of the logo of each social media and brand and music streaming service used for user familiarity. 
- The homepage uses the logo used in the favicon which is taken from the most recent album. This is then used down the page to break up areas of text and show a clear divide between various sections.  

#### Backgrounds

- Homepage image is an image being used for a lot of festival and concert promotion for the band creating familiarity and consistency so the user immediately knows they are in the right place  
- Band bio page is the full image of the solo images used futher down the page again making it easy for the user to identify who's who 
- Media page image is a repeating gif showing an action show from a music video a snapshot of what the user will see further down the page

Balsamiq was used to wireframe the project in the initial planning stages. As the project developed some aspects changed inlcuding - 
- Making the homepage more of a feature and more interactive by adding in the gallery section from the Music page. 
- Taking the subsricption "connect" section from the seperate contact page to the bottom of the homepage. This provides a better flow and a simpler more user friendly site. 
- Social networking links were also taken from the top of the Navigation bar to a more prominent position in the footer to give the site a better aesthetic.
- Text and Buttons were taken out of the cover hero images so they would have more impact. 
- Return to previous page button was removed from the band member pop-up box and close icon made more prominent.
