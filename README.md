### > Design Choices 

The overall feel of the site should be simple and clean and inkeeping with the band's overall "rock" brand. 
The following choices were made with this in mind. 

#### Fonts 

The font chosen is Archivo narrow which is in line with the rest of the styling inkeeping with the style of the most 
recent album released by the band. It has straight lines and is a simple, easy to read font. 

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) reviewed when deciding on font styling for the site. 

#### Icons 

- Standard icons for brands such as spotify, apple, social media used for familiarity of the user. 
- Mainpage has the Foo Fighters Logo from the most recent album as an icon header creating recognition when the user goes to buy or stream the album. 
- Favicon is the same as the logo used through the site to provide consistency throughout.

#### Colors

- Background color throughout '#060505' selected to match the styling of the most recent album and the official band website to credit familiarity and consistency. 
- Font color '#d4Af37' used throughout selected to match the color of the logo and styling on the most recent album to show consistency and familiarity.  
- Band info page close button on modal made '#ffffff' for ease of user to identify how to close the window. 
- Calendar color '#d4Af37' for header and '#f9f2e0' for body used to make a recognisible calendar format, with the #f9f2e0 a big contrast to background and header to make it instantly noticeable. 

Color selection made using - 
- [HTML Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/)
- [Rapid Tables - Gold Color](https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/Gold_Color.html) 

#### Styling 

- Each page is styled with a strong cover image giving an indication of the content of the page.
- Cover images across all pages styled at 80% screen height across all devices with the page header visible under the image to encourage user to scroll down to see the rest of the content. 
- Footer icons styled at 30px so they are easily noticed. Standard icons of the logo of each social media and brand and music streaming service used for user familiarity. 
- The homepage uses the logo used in the favicon which is taken from the most recent album. This is then used down the page to break up areas of text and show a clear divide between various sections.  

#### Backgrounds

- Homepage image is an image being used for a lot of festival and concert promotion for the band creating familiarity and consistency so the user immediately knows they are in the right place  
- Band bio page is the full image of the solo images used futher down the page again making it easy for the user to identify who's who 
- Media page image is a repeating gif showing an action show from a music video a snapshot of what the user will see further down the page 
- Shows page is an empty stage image making it clear this is the page to be on to be able to see them perform live 

### > Wireframes 

- [Home Page](https://github.com/helendaisy/milestone-band-project/blob/master/assets/wireframes/homepagewireframe.png)

Balsamiq was used to wireframe the project in the initial planning stages. As the project developed some aspects changed inlcuding - 
- Making the homepage more of a feature and more interactive by adding in the gallery section from the Music page. 
- Taking the subscription "connect" section from the seperate contact page to the bottom of the homepage. This provides a better flow and a simpler more user friendly site. 
- Social networking links were also taken from the top of the Navigation bar to a more prominent position in the footer to give the site a better aesthetic.
- Text and Buttons were taken out of the cover hero images so they would have more impact. 
- Return to previous page button was removed from the band member pop-up box and close icon made more prominent.

It is written in short paragraphs so the user isn't put off by large chunks of text and encourages them to keep scrolling down the page.

This page has split a full image of the band into the indvidual members so the user and learn quickly and simpy who is who. 
An image with a white background was used to really grab the attention of the user. 
The mouse is formatted to change when hovering over each image to indicate that the user can click into each image to find out more. 

##### Individual Pop-Ups
The modal pop up box contains -

#### [Listen Page](https://helendaisy.github.io/milestone-band-project/media.html)

A gif taken from a music video is used here as the cover image. Gifs are a popular tool in communication concisely showing the point of the page.  
The movement here shows the user that this is a more interactive page and gives an insight into them performing. 

##### Listen 
- The Greatest Hits image used is the cover of the album so that when the user goes on to purchase or stream the songs they will easily recognise the album. 
- 5 of the most popular songs have been chosen to give the user a sample of the band. If the user is unaware of the band these songs will probably be the most recognisible and encourage further listening.

- It allows the user to play and pause the song and change the volume easily. 
- There are buttons inviting the listener to listen further through their choice of music streaming. The two most popular have been used as it is likely people will be aware of one or both.

Most users are familiar with the layout and look of a youtube link. Clicking anywhere on the cover image will play the video with options to pause, change volume and alter to full screen.

This is a simple page in a calendar style so the user can easily see upcoming tour dates, locations and the names of the events. 
Each calendar section contains a button taking the user to a ticket site where they can purchase tickets to the event.
