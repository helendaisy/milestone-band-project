(link to github page)

## UX

### Project Goals 

This website is a one-stop shop for people who want to find out about the band Foo Fighters, it provides a brief overview of the band's 
history, a selection of their biggest hits and a music video and images of the band to introduce people to the band and entice them to engage 
on social media, buy or stream their music and videos and come along to their gigs. Essentially to convert people to become fans of the band. 

The target audience for this site is anyone aged 10 to 100 who isn't currently a fan of or aware of the Foo Fighters. 

The information is split into simple bitesize areas rather than overloadng with details and content to highlight the key areas of the band 
so that users can decide quickly if they want to explore more. The site should be responsive and suitable on all screen sizes and browsers.

### Design Choices 

The overall feel of the site should be simple and clean and inkeeping with the band's overall "rock" brand. 
The following choices were made with this in mind. 

#### Fonts 

The font chosen is Archivo narrow which is in line with the rest of the styling inkeeping with the style of the most 
recent album released by the band. It has stright lines and is a simple, easy to read font. 

#### Icons 

- Standard icons for brands such as spotify, apple, social media used for familiarity of the user. 
- Mainpage has the Foo Fighters Logo from the most recent album as an icon header creating recognition when the user goes to buy or stream the album. 
- Favicon is the same as the logo used through the site to provide consistency throughout.

#### Colours

- navbar colours and why 
- main page background colour 
- font / highlight colour 
- calendar colour 

#### Styling 

- styles 

#### Backgrounds

- Homepage image is an image being used for a lot of festival and concert promotion for the band creating familiarity and consistency so the user immediately knows they are in the right place  
- Band bio page is the full image of the solo images used futher down the page again making it easy for the user to identify who's who 
- Media page image is a repeating gif showing an action show from a music video a snapshot of what the user will see further down the page 
- Shows page is an empty stage image making it clear this is the page to be on to be able to see them perform live
